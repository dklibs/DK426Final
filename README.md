# DK426Final
This is Darith Klibanow's final project for Comp426. 
It is a MineSweeper game built in React with a firebase backend to keep track of users. 
When you enter the home page, you will see a randomly generated robot appear using the RoboHash api, and it will tell a random joke pulled from a random joke api. 
A link to the game can be found here: https://dkfinal-45a35.web.app
